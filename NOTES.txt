*MAIN NOTES*

1. Put modules in a modules folder
2. Don't variablise everything.
3. Add security.tf -> put all SGs there.
4. Public instances = bastion hosts
5. Private instances = code
6. Uncomment modules one at a time, don't apply everything all at once.

*NEXT STEPS*
# public and private instances running
# delete the public and use ALB
# Use an alb to access private ec2 instance -> use acm (Add my personal domain and put in certificates)
# run nginx on private ec2 instance -> use Hasti's code
